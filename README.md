FairFare Ride Demand & Prediction Analysis
Project Description:

This project involves ride data analysis, driver performance evaluation, demand assessment,
and fare prediction using Machine Learning (Linear Regression). Additionally, driver behavior,city trends, 
and travel patterns have been analyzed to gain insights into pricing trends and transportation activities.

Project Contents:
•	The following files contain processed data, model outputs, and analytical reports.
•	File = Description 
•	top_fare_city_max.csv 
•	processed_fairfare_results.csv = Analysis results, including fare predictions and driver rankings.
•	top_score_driver.csv = List of drivers (replaced with cities due to lack of direct driver access) with high performance scores. 
•	top_fare_city.csv = Cities with the highest ride revenue.
•	currency_conversion.csv = Fare conversion to INR currency. 
•	acceptance_percentage.csv = Ride fare acceptance percentage by drivers.
•	all_cities_future_predictions.csv | Predicted ride fares for the next 9 days. 
•	advanced_challenge_ml.py = Project code, including data analysis and machine learning model.
•	Driver_information.py = Project code, including data analysis
•	Customer_Behavior.py = Project code, including data analysis
•	city_Level_Performance.py = Project code, including data analysis
•	fairfare_ride_demand_dataset (1).csv = Is the dataset with CSV format including 10.000.000 rows and 29 columns.
•	READMEme  = This guide file explaining project execution and structure.



How to Run the Project:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
To run the project, first install the necessary libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Step 2: Execute the Fare Prediction Model:
python   FairFare_Model.py


Step 3: Review Output Files

After running the code, the key output files containing analysis and predictions will be saved:
processed_fairfare_results.csv: Includes the overall data analysis.
all_cities_future_predictions.csv: Contains predicted ride fares for the upcoming days.

Project Features:
•	Analysis of top drivers based on performance and experience
